# CrypED
A Cryptomining based approach to Education 
## EduConnect
Cryptocurrency Based Computational Power for Education Programmes
### Challenge Category: SDG4 - ‘Quality Education’
Our idea has successfully incorporated all the seven outcome targets under
Sustainable Development Goal for Quality Education (SDG 4) by the effective
implementation of an efficient learning environment.
### Problem Definition
In this digital age, education without the computer and internet connectivity
seems like a dystopian reality. Unfortunately, this is the harsh reality that plaques
the underprivileged masses. Laptops, tablets and devices made available by
government and international programmes lack the high-end hardware necessary
for higher learning and greater knowledge. Furthermore, lack of funds or its
mismanagement lead to loss of beneficiaries and an overall loss to society.
Abstract
Our idea is to develop a blockchain based cryptocurrency system, which allows
users, globally, to lend their computational power for those who need it.
#### Technology – Oracle Blockchain, Oracle Analytics Cloud
### Objectives
• Use of cost-efficient computer devices
• Management of donations using blockchain
• Increased accessibility and efficient use of computational power
• Education for sustainable development
• Improved connectivity and learning environment for all
• Relevant skill development for decent work
### Methodology
➢ Donations from benefactors are stored in blockchain as cryptocurrency
➢ Provide and use laptops with minimalistic computation for education
➢ When excess computational power is needed, place request to peer network
➢ Blockchain provides interconnection for distributed computing
➢ Users interested in sharing computational power earns cryptocurrency
➢ If needed, philanthropic users can donate their earned cryptocurrency
➢ All transactions and community efforts are securely stored in blockchain
